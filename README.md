## Deployed Heroku app

## Description 

This is a note taker program which can save user entered notes into a backend server and use said server to load up saved notes when the user needs them. It does not need ay back end deployment, assuming the user the using deployed link to heroku above. In case they want to run it locally, some initializaton will be necessary. 

## Installation and Deployment

This application is fully deployed and ready to use in the heroku link, however for keen minds all you have to go is clone the repo into you local machine and open the command line on the same file level as the downloaded application. Run the command `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies for this application. Then run `node server.js` in the folder where that file is saved. This is not a backend usage application, so you will have to search for `http://localhost:3000/notes` in the browser and interact with is.
